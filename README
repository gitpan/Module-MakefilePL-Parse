NAME
    Module::MakefilePL::Parse - parse required modules from Makefile.PL

REQUIREMENTS
    Perl 5.6.1 is required.

    The following modules are required:

      Test::More
      Test::Warn

Installation
    Installation can be done using the traditional Makefile.PL or the
    newer Build.PL methods.

    Using Makefile.PL:

      perl Makefile.PL
      make
      make test
      make install

    (On Windows platforms you should use nmake instead.)

    Using Build.PL (if you have Module::Build installed):

      perl Build.PL
      perl Build
      perl Build test
      perl Build install    

SYNOPSIS
      use Module::MakefilePL::Parse;

      open $fh, 'Makefile.PL';

      $parser = Module::MakefilePL::Parse->new( join(" ", <$fh>) );

      $info   = $parser->required;

DESCRIPTION
    The purpose of this module is to determine the required modules for
    older CPAN distributions which do not have META.yml files but use
    Makefile.PL and ExtUtils::MakeMaker or Module::Install.

    Please see the module documentation for more details.
