NAME
    Module::MakefilePL::Parse - parse required modules from Makefile.PL

SYNOPSIS
      use Module::MakefilePL::Parse;

      open $fh, 'Makefile.PL';

      $parser = Module::MakefilePL::Parse->new( join(" ", <$fh>) );

      $info   = $parser->required;

DESCRIPTION
    The purpose of this module is to determine the required modules for
    older CPAN distributions which do not have META.yml files but use
    Makefile.PL and ExtUtils::MakeMaker.

    Presumably newer style Makefile.PL files which use Module::Install or
    Module::Build already have META.yml files in their distributions.

    Please see the module documentation for more details.
